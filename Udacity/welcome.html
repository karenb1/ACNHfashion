                    My name is Karen and I am learning how to code to become a front-end web developer. I currently work as an <b>advanced dental therapist</b> in St. Paul, MN. This means I work with teeth and get to be very artistic making fillings look lovely!<br>
                    The image in fig. 1 is of my character in <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizon</i>. She is wearing an outfit very similar to what I wear at work! A white lab coat, dress pants and shoes, along with glasses to help me see everything I am doing! I always wear my hair up to keep it out of my face, the only things missing are my mask and my gloves to keep my patients safe!
